I am assistant professor in Data Science and researcher at the [School of Science & Technology](https://www.ie.edu/school-science-technology/) at [IE University](https://www.ie.edu/) and Chief Scientist of the [Health & Tech Lab](https://www.ie.edu/impactxcelerator/areas/health-technology/) at [ImpactXcelerator](https://www.ie.edu/impactxcelerator/).

Before joining IE University, from 2014 to 2022, I was a researcher at [BCAM - Basque Center for Applied Mathematics](http://www.bcamath.org/en/) in Bilbao, where I led the research line in Applied Statistics and coordinated the area of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence of the [Knowledge Transfer Unit](https://www.bcamath.org/en/knowledge-transfer/knowledge-transfer-unit) at the Center.

From 2011 to 2014, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/en/) (the Commonwealth Industrial and Research Organization), Division of Mathematics and Statistics, today [Data61](https://research.csiro.au/data61/), in [Melbourne, Australia](https://www.visitmelbourne.com/).

My current research is Biostatistics, statistical modelling with applications in Health, biomedical applications, environmental modelling and sports sciences.
