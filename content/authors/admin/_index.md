I am assistant professor in Data Science and researcher at the School of Science & Technology at IE University and Chief Scientist of the Health & Tech Lab at ImpactXcelerator. 

Before joining IE University, from 2014 to 2022, I was a researcher at BCAM - Basque Center for Applied Mathematics in Bilbao, where I led the research line in Applied Statistics and coordinated the area of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence of the Knowledge Transfer Unit at the Center. 

From 2011 to 2014, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at CSIRO (the Commonwealth Industrial and Research Organization), Division of Mathematics and Statistics, today Data61, in Melbourne, Australia.

My current research is Biostatistics, statistical modelling with applications in Health, biomedical applications, environmental modelling and sports sciences.
